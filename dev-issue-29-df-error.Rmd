```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
source("R/freq_table.R")
```

```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

```{r}
freq_table(mtcars)
```
 
 Left off here... This works, but I need to check and see what happens when I pass a column that only has one value. 
 
```{r}
mtcars$test <- "Blue"
```
 
```{r}
freq_table(mtcars, test)
```

Awesome! It still works!

Now, make some unit tests!
