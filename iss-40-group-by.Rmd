Playing with group_by. Delete when you are done. 

# ðŸ“¦Load packages

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
```

Cyl is the outcome var of interest

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  freq_table(cyl)
```

Now, cyl within levels of am

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(am) %>%
  freq_table(cyl)
```

That is the result we want. However, this works too.

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  freq_table(am, cyl)
```

If that didn't what would we want it to return instead? A list of one-way tables?

I think I also want to get rid of some of this output. It's too much.
